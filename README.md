# Computer Vision: Plant Seedling Classification

## Overview
This repository contains the **Plant Seedling Classification** project, completed as part of the Computer Vision course offered by Great Learning in collaboration with UT Austin. The aim of the project is to build a convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier capable of accurately identifying plant seedlings from images.

## Context
Agriculture significantly depends on manual labor for identifying and sorting plant seedlings and weeds, which is a tedious and time-consuming process. Advances in artificial intelligence, especially convolutional neural networks, can greatly streamline this task by automating plant classification, thereby improving efficiency, crop yields, and promoting sustainable agricultural practices.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to build a CNN-based model to classify images of plant seedlings into their respective species.

## Data Description
The dataset provided by Aarhus University Signal Processing Group in collaboration with the University of Southern Denmark includes images of plant seedlings belonging to 12 unique species.

**Data Files:**
- Download the image dataset from [this link](https://bit.ly/3XAkS4q).
- `images.npy`: Numpy array containing images.
- `Labels.csv`: CSV file containing labels for the images.

**Species Included:**
- Black-grass
- Charlock
- Cleavers
- Common Chickweed
- Common Wheat
- Fat Hen
- Loose Silky-bent
- Maize
- Scentless Mayweed
- Shepherds Purse
- Small-flowered Cranesbill
- Sugar beet
