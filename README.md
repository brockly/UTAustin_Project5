# Credit Card Users Churn Prediction

## Overview
This repository hosts the **Credit Card Users Churn Prediction** project, completed as part of the Data Science and Machine Learning course by Great Learning in collaboration with UT Austin. The aim of this project is to build a predictive model to identify customers likely to churn from credit card services.

## Business Context
Thera Bank has observed customer churn in its credit card services, significantly impacting revenue generated through various credit card fees. Understanding reasons behind customer churn and accurately predicting potential churners is critical for proactive retention efforts and maintaining profitability.

## Objective
- Predict customer churn using machine learning classification models.
- Identify key factors contributing to customer churn.
- Provide actionable insights to reduce churn rates and enhance customer retention.
